## Completing the Assignment

1. Clone the repository on a UNIX machine using the command `git clone URL` for the URL of your repository.
2. For each question on the handout on Brightspace, write the function in its corresponding C file in the repository. Note: You do not need to edit the main function in any of these files; these each run some test cases. Make sure that your code compiles and runs properly on the LDAP machines.
3. Regularly push edits you make in your local repository using the commands `git commit -a -m "commit comment"` to commit the changes you made, and `git push` to update the master repository.
4. Once you are finished, post the 40-hex-character hash code of your final commit in the assignment link on Brightspace. You can obtain this code using the command `git rev-parse HEAD`.
